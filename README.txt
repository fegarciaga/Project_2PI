The idea of the project is to benchmark a 2PI-based method for open quantum system dynamics.
The obtained dynamics are then benchmarked against Lindblad master equation in the weakly coupled regime
and against HEOM in the strongly coupled regime.

Lindblad simulations are performed using the universal Lindblad equation.

HEOM calcualtions are performed using the extension of qutip library.
